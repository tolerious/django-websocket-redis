"The Websocket protocol implements so called PING/PONG messages to keep "
"Websockets alive, even behind proxies, firewalls and load-balancers. The "
"server sends a PING message to the client through the Websocket, which "
"then replies with PONG. If the client does not reply, the server closes "
"the connection."

"Unfortunately, the Websocket protocol does not provide a similar method "
"for the client, to find out if it is still connected to the server. This "
"can happen, if the connection simply disappears without further "
"notification. In order to have the client recognize this, some Javascript"
" code has to be added to the client code responsible for the Websocket:"

"The heartbeat message, here ``--heartbeat--`` can be any magic string "
"which does not interfere with your remaining logic. The best way to "
"achieve this, is to check for that magic string inside the receive "
"function, just before further processing the message:"

"The main loop of the Websocket server is idle for a maximum of 4 seconds,"
" even if there is nothing to do. After that time interval has elapsed, "
"this loop optionally sends a magic string to the client. This can be "
"configured using the special setting:"

"The purpose of this setting is twofold. During processing, the server "
"ignores incoming messages containing this magic string. Additionally the "
"Websocket server sends a message with that magic string to the client, "
"about every four seconds. The above client code awaits these messages, at"
" least every five seconds, and if too many were not received, it closes "
"the connection and tries to reestablish it."

"By default the setting ``WS4REDIS_HEARTBEAT`` is ``None``, which means "
